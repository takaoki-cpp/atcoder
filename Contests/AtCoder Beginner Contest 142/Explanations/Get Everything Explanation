Let us make a bitmask corresponding to each of the keys. 

If a key can open box i, then we will set the i-th bit in the binary representation of mask[i]. 

There are only 12 boxes, which is what allows us this idea. 

------

Let us use a DP f(i, m). 

Where f(i, m) is the minimum cost it takes to open boxes represented by m using only the first i keys. 

For example, if m = 00110110, then it means that we must be able to open the second, third, fourth and fifth boxes exactly. 

----

Let us try to build a recurrence for this ? 

We have two options for the i-th key. 

----

Case 1 - We do not use it. 

Then, f(i, m) = f(i - 1, m)

This is very straightforward. It's simply the same as doing it until the first (i - 1) keys. 

---

Case 2 - We use the i-th box

Now, here is the first approach that came to my mind.
