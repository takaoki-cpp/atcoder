We are given the position P[i] of all the i students. 

Let us make another array called Correct[i]

Then, we will do 1 O(n) pass through the array

And set Correct[P[i]] = i

Because i should be present in the P[i]-th position

And then we can print the Correct array in O(n) time

int main()

    int no_of_students;
    cin >> no_of_students;

    vector <int> position(no_of_students + 1, 0);
    for(int i = 1; i <= no_of_students; i++)
        cin >> position[i];

    vector <int> correct_order(no_of_students + 1, 0);
    for(int i = 1; i <= no_of_students; i++)
        correct_order[position[i]] = i;

    for(int i = 1; i <= no_of_students; i++)
        cout << correct_order[i] << " ";
