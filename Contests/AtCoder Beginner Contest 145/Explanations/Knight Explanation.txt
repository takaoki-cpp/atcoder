Firstly, the constraints are too big to do a DP. 

1. Let us notice the sum (i, j) (mod 3) is an invariant at each step. 

Initially it is 0. So, if (X + Y) = 0 (mod 3), we can reach (X, Y). Otherwise, no.

2. Now, let us suppose that we make R moves of the kind (i + 1, j + 2) and D moves of the kind (i + 2, j + 1). 

Then, 

R + 2D = X
2R + D = Y

Since we know the values of X and Y, let us try to write (D, R) in terms of (X, Y)

2X - Y = 3D
2Y - X = 3R

3. Now that we know the values of (D, R), we need to count the number of strings of length (D + R) with D d's and R r's. This string is uniquely determined by the placement of the d's or the r's. 

So, the answer = C(D + R, D) = C(D + R, R)

Or course, both D and R have to be > 0

int main()
{
    int X, Y;
    cin >> X >> Y;

    if( (X + Y)%3 != 0)
    {
        cout << "0\n";

        return 0;
    }

    long long D = (2*Y - X)/3;
    long long L = (2*X - Y)/3;

    const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
    cout << ( (D < 0 || L < 0) ? 0 : combinations(D + L, D, MOD) );

    return 0;
}
