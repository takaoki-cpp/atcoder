Let f(i, H) be the total happiness till the i-th day with Homework on the i-th day. 

Similarly, let f(i, B) and f(i, S) represent the happiness on the i-th day if a bug is found or swimming is done on the i-th day respectively. 

Then, f(i, H) = H[i] + Max{f(i - 1, B), f(i - 1, S)}

We add whichever is better - Bug or Swimming on the (i-1) th day.

Similarly, we find f(i, B) and f(i, S).

Answer = max{f(N, H), f(N, B), f(N, S)}
