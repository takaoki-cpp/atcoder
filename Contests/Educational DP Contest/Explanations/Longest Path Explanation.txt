Let f(v) represent the longest path from vertex v in terms of number of vertices. 

Then if the children of v are c1 and c2

f(v) = 1 + max{f(c1), f(c2)}

The answer is f(v) - 1. 

Because the question asks us to count the number of edges on the longest path. And a path of v vertices require exactly v - 1 edges. 

We want to find the longest path in each component as it is not guaranteed that the graph is a single connected component.
