First make as many conventional pieces as possible. 

We can make min(S, C/2) such pieces. 

Then reduce the S and Cs accordingly. 

Then we can make a new piece for ever 4 Cs. 

This greedy algorithm is optimal. 

---------------------------------------------

int main()
{
	long long S, C;
	cin >> S >> C;

	long long no_of_pieces = min(S, C/2);

	S -= no_of_pieces;
	C -= 2*no_of_pieces;

	no_of_pieces += C/4;

	cout << no_of_pieces;
	return 0;
}
