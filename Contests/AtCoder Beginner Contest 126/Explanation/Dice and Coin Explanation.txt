We will get any of the N scores with probability 1/N. 

If we get a score >= K, then we don't need to toss the coin further. 

If we get a score < K, then we need to keep tossing heads till the score crosses K. Even one tail will cause us to lose. 

We will iterate over every possible score from 1 to N. 
And then see how many heads we need for the score to go beyond N. 

If we require H heads after getting score i, then the probability will increase by (1/i2^H)
