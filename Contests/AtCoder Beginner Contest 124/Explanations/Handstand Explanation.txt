Observation 1 - It is always best to flip a whole segment of 0s. In other words, in one operation, we must touch a whole segment of 0s.

If we flip less than an entire segment of 0s, we can always get more 1s by flipping the entire segment of 0s. 

Suppose we flip more than one 0-segment, then our answer cannot be more than it would be by flipping the largest 0-segment that we have flipped. 
If 2 0-segments were disjoint initially, they will remain disjoin even after we perform the operation because the dividing 1-segment
becomes a 0-segment.

Hence, in one operation, it is always optimal to touch exactly one 0-segment completely.

-----

When we perform K operations, we must flip K consecutive 0-segments. 

We will check the number of 1s we can get if we flip every set of consecutive K 0-segments and then choose the one which maximises 
number of 1s.

-----

Now that we have made this observation, we must do this. 

Rather than think of it as a string of 0s and 1s, let us maintain two arrays - 

Z 
O

Z[i] will hold the length of the i-th segment of 0s

O[i] will hold the length of the i-th segment of 1s

Suppose S = 01110011011

Then, 

Z = | 1 | 2 | 1 |
O = | 3 | 2 | 2 |

We will flip some contiguous set of zero-segments. 

We will flip Z[L] , Z[L + 1], ... , Z[R - 1], Z[R]

When we flip K 0-segments, we need to add the (K - 1) 1-segments in between and the 2 1-segments at each end. 
So there will be K + 1 segments of 1 that should also be counted. 

But, this is where we need to be careful.

----

The number of continuous ones will then be either

1. Z[L] + O[L] + Z[L + 1] + O[L + 1] + ... + O[R - 1] + Z[R - 1] + O[R] + Z[R] + O[R + 1]

or

2. O[L - 1] + Z[L] + O[L] + ... + O[R - 1] + Z[R] + O[R] + Z[R]

(We will add either O[L - 1] or O[R + 1] but not both. Remember there have to be K + 1 1-segments. Not more)

---

Suppose the first segment is of 0s. 
Then Z[1] comes before O[1], Z[2] before O[2] , ... Z[i] before O[i]. 

Then when we are taking the sum of the segment from [L, R], we need to add O[L - 1] seperately as an extra. 

Suppose the first segment is of 1s. 
Then O[1] comes before Z[1], O[2] before Z[2] and O[i] before Z[i]. 

When we want the segment length of continuous 1s on flipping [L, R], we need to add O[R + 1] seperately as an extra.
