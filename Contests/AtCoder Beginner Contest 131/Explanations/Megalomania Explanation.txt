Let us sort the events by their deadlines. Events who's deadlines come earlier need to be completed first. 

Keep track of the time consumed at each point and verify if it is before each deadline. 

----

int main()
{
    int no_of_events;
    cin >> no_of_events;

    vector <event> E(no_of_events);
    for(int i = 0; i < no_of_events; i++)
    {
        cin >> E[i].time >> E[i].deadline;
    }

    sort(all(E));

    int time_now = 0, possible = true;
    for(int i = 0; i < no_of_events; i++)
    {
        time_now += E[i].time;

        if(time_now > E[i].deadline)
            possible = false;
    }

    cout << (possible ? "Yes" : "No");
    return 0;
}
