It is given that the data is already consistent. We need not check that. 

Let us take the score of the last person. Let is be S, let his rank be R. 

It means there are at least R players. 

Now, it is possible for people to score S - 1, S - 2, S - 3, ... 2, 1, 0

So, if he scores S, then there can be S more players. 

Answer = R + S, where R is the rank of the last player and S is his score.
