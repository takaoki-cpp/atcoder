Maintain a list of all words that have been used. 

For each incoming word, check if it has already been used and if the first character is the same as the last character of the previous word.

int main()
{
    int no_of_words;
    cin >> no_of_words;

    int rules_followed = true;

    map <string, int> used;
    string previous_word;
    for(int i = 1; i <= no_of_words; i++)
    {
        string current_word;
        cin >> current_word;

        if(used[current_word] || (i > 1 && current_word[0] != previous_word[previous_word.size() - 1]))
           rules_followed = false;

        used[current_word] = true;
        previous_word = current_word;
    }

    cout << (rules_followed ? "Yes\n" : "No\n");
    return 0;
