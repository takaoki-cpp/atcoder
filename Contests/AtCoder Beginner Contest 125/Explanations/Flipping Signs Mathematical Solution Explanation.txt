We can always ensure that the number of negative elements remaining in the end is at most 1. 

In one operation, we can reduce the number of negative elments by either 0 or 2. So, if there were an odd number of negative elements in the beginning, there will always be at least one negative element.

So, we will ensure that the minimum element is negative.
