Constraints are small enough to simulate. HOwever there are very few numbers with 8 divisors numbers which are odd and less than 200. So, the answer can be precomputed beforehand.

--------------------------------------

int main()
{
    int n;
    scanf("%d", &n);

    int answer = 0;
    for(int i = 1; i <= n; i += 2)
    {
        if(divisor_count(i) == 8)
            answer++;
    }

    printf("%d\n", answer);
    return 0;
}
