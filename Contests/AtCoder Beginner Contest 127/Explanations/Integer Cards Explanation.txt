It is always optimal to replace the smallest element of A with the largest element of C. 

We will do this - 

A1 <= A2 <= ... <= An

And then we will start replacing the As with the largest Cs, if the current C is greater than the A.

Time Complexity is O(n) since we will visit each element at most once.
