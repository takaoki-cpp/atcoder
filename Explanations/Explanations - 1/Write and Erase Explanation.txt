You are playing the following game with Joisino.

Initially, you have a blank sheet of paper.
Joisino announces a number. If that number is written on the sheet, erase the number from the sheet; if not, write the number on the sheet. 
This process is repeated N times.
Then, you are asked a question: How many numbers are written on the sheet now?
The numbers announced by Joisino are given as A1,…,AN in the order she announces them. How many numbers will be written on the sheet at the end of the game?
