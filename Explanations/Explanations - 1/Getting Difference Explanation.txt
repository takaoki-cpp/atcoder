here is a box containing N balls. The i-th ball has the integer Ai written on it. Snuke can perform the following operation any number of times:

Take out two balls from the box. Then, return them to the box along with a new ball, on which the absolute difference of the integers written on the two balls is written.
Determine whether it is possible for Snuke to reach the state where the box contains a ball on which the integer K is written.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Firstly notice that the gcd of all numbers in the ball is the same. 

This is because gcd(a, b) = gcd(a, a - b) = gcd(b, a - b)

So, eventually we will get a ball with the gcd written on it.

Once we have that, we can use the gcd ball and the maximum number ball, to get every multiple of gcd upto the maximum number ball.

For example gcd = g, Max = ng

We get (n - 1)g

And then (n - 2)g and so on.

We get all numbers in the series g, 2g, 3g, 4g, ... ng.

I made the mistake where I just said k is possible if it a multiple of gcd. I forgot to check that it has to be smaller than the maximum.
